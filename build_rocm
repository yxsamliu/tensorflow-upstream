# Explicitly delete the old whl packages in the /tmp/tensorflow_pkg dir
# Doing so comes in handy when the TF version number changes, because
# it will cause the last line in this script (pip3 install ...) to fail.
# Not deleting the old whl packages results in the last line installing
# TF from the previous whl pakcage (if present) and not the current one
# that was just built by this script. Since this error is not apparent, it
# can lead to a lot of frustation and lost time trying to figure why the
# changes made in the current build are not working!
